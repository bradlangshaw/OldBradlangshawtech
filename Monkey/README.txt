1. a) I chose SVG, Images and CSS because I enjoy working with illustrator and have a solid understanding of CSS 
   and I wanted to get practice using Javascript(Jquery) to manipulate those in different ways.
  
   b) I knew how to make SVG files out of scanned drawings and I knew pretty much all of the code put into these files from previous work, I just put it to different use
  
   c) For the most part I only used stackover flow for some answers on how to put audio files into the html and how to make them play via js at which point I figured out the Jquery method i used on my own.
   I used Jquery documentation to relearn the .attr and I was considering putting in bootstrap carousel that would also move the background on every click 
   becasuse the background svg was drawn to be loopable 

   d) The most challenging part of the assignment was getting the separate SVG files to line up and still be lined up after the button was clicked. Other than that it wasn't that difficult.
